# VocalFolder

**Vocal Folder** is a desktop application built for linguists, phoneticians, and phonologists working with speech data. It offers an intuitive interface for exploring, editing, and analyzing time-aligned annotations from Praat TextGrids, fully synchronized with their corresponding audio files. Load entire folders of `.wav` + `.TextGrid` pairs, navigate annotation tiers, visualize waveforms, play individual segments, and extract key acoustic measures‚Äîall without writing code, all within a single unified window. Vocal Folder is especially useful as an intermediate step between spectrographic analysis in Praat and statistical modeling in R: it allows you to curate your data visually, filter by phonological variables or speaker metadata, and export clean, customizable datasets as R-ready CSV files.

## üö© Why Vocal Folder?

- **Multi-file & Multi-tier**  
  Load an entire directory of `.wav/TextGrid` pairs at once and instantly see every interval tier in a dropdown. Jump between tiers to compare annotation layers or speakers.

- **Rich Waveform & Playback**  
  ‚Ä¢ Full-file and segment-zoom views  
  ‚Ä¢ Click any row (or press Tab) to play that interval  
  ‚Ä¢ One-click highlight of the current segment in the waveform

- **Structured Label Parsing**  
  Automatically split hyphenated labels (e.g. `b-una_burra-fem`) into `Var1`, `Var2`, ‚Ä¶ columns‚Äîtoggle each on/off, rename them (e.g. ‚ÄúGender‚Äù), and seamlessly weave them into your table view.

- **On-the-fly Annotation Editing**  
  Toggle ‚ÄúEdit Mode‚Äù to rename files or interval labels right in the table. Unsaved edits glow yellow; saving writes back to your TextGrids (and renames `.wav`/`.TextGrid` pairs if you change filenames).

- **Flexible Filtering & Views**  
  Excel-style dropdown filters on any variable column‚Äîquickly drill down to subsets of speakers, contexts, or phonological categories. Filter status appears in the header so you never lose track.

- **Instant Acoustic Features**  
  Select which features to show in your table:
  - **Duration**  
  - **Mid-interval Intensity** (via Praat/Parselmouth)  
  - **Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)**  
  - **Spectral Centroid** (via Librosa)  
  - **Formant Frequencies** (F1‚ÄìF3, midpoint or mean)  
  Compute and cache everything under the hood‚Äîno code, just check the boxes.

- **Export & Share**  
  Save your filtered, edited table to CSV for downstream stats, charts, or archiving.

   cd vocal-folder
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Launch app**
    ```bash
    python app/main.py

3.	**Workflow**
	- Load a folder of .wav + .TextGrid files
	- Select Tier to inspect a specific annotation layer
