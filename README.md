# Vocal Folder

**Vocal Folder** is a dynamic annotation browser and audio segmentation toolkit for phonetic research. It allows you to load `.wav` + `.TextGrid` pairs, browse annotations, view waveforms, and play back segments directly from the UI ‚Äî all without scripting.

## ‚úÖ Features (MVP Complete)

- [x] Folder loader: parse `.wav` + `.TextGrid` file pairs
- [x] Display selected working directory in header
- [x] Dynamic tier selection (adapts to user project)
- [x] Table view of intervals: File, Label, Start, End, Duration
- [x] Smart detection of structured labels (e.g. `b-una_burra-a-b-u-ton-ext-f-fem-jov`)
  - Optional parsing of label into variable columns
  - Header names are editable (e.g. `var1`, `var2` ‚Üí `place`, `gender`, etc.)
- [x] Waveform viewer with segment zoom
- [x] Click-to-select behavior:
  - Click ‚ÄúFile‚Äù: shows full waveform
  - Click ‚ÄúLabel‚Äù: shows full waveform, plays segment on waveform click
  - Click anywhere else: zooms into selected segment
- [x] Playback integration: prevents overlapping playback
- [x] Tab key triggers playback for selected segment
- [x] Tier-aware segment editing
  - Edits tracked visually (light yellow)
  - Option to rename `.wav` + `.TextGrid` if filename is changed
  - Save prompt before closing

## üß≠ Roadmap

- [ ] Waveform overlays for labeled intervals
- [ ] Filtering by label type, variable, or duration
- [ ] Acoustic feature extraction: duration, intensity, F1, F2, ZCR, tilt
- [ ] CSV export of filtered intervals and features
- [ ] Spectrogram overlay toggle
- [ ] Undo/redo support and per-cell history
- [ ] Preferences panel (e.g., default tier, playback speed, export config)
- [ ] File renaming rules based on metadata
